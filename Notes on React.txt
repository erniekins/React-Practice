            ^ the end compiled file     ^ file being compiled 
    >babel src/app.js --out-file=public/scripts/app.js --presets=env,react --watch

reinstall node modules  >yarn install

JSX attributes
class is now className b/c class is reservered for creating classes

e.preventDefaul(); prevents the page refreshing

Binding usign bind() - for more mdn bind 
reset the context for this

const obj = {
    name: "Vik",
    getName() {
        return this.name
    }
};
const getName = obj.getName.bind(obj);

console.log(getName());


Component State
        1. Setup defaultt state object 
        2. Component rendered with defaul state values* ( * don't call render is implicit)
        3. Change state based on event
        4. Component rerenders using new state values*
        5. Start again at 3

state is an object with key value pairs shows what will be rendered to screen with initial data
can be changed by us (ie button click)
when change state it will automatically rerender

Props v State

Props:
object
can be used when rendering
changes *from above* cause re render
comes from above
can't be changed by the Component

State: 
object
can be used when rendering
changes cause re render
defined in component itself
can be change by the component

Stateless Functional Component 
        faster and lighter than class comp
        if don't need state than make is Stateless

WEBPACK
    allows to organize javascript - makes one file for all javscript so only one script
    tag in the html

export and imports
    default there is only one
        can change name on import 
    named exports there can be as many as needed

SCSS -
    rem = 16px
